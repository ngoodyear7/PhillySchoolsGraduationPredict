CIS 4397 Final Resources, Code, and CSV's

Hi Dr. Newby, while I explored many more files for the project, only these were relevant to my final paper. If you'd like to see more, let me know. Thanks for a great semester and I hope to stay in touch. Thanks for everything, from this class, to Phys 2511, to Modern Physics I have really appreciated the time I've gotten to know you.
